- **TodoInput**: Component for adding new todos.
- **TodoList**: Component to display a list of todos.
- **CompletedTodoList**: Component to display a list of completed todos.

The `TodoInput` component is responsible for taking user input for new todos. It contains input fields for title and description and a button to add the todo.

## TodoList Component üìã

The `TodoList` component displays a list of todos. It receives the list of todos as props and maps through them to display each todo item. Each todo item has options to delete, complete, and edit.

The `CompletedTodoList` component displays a list of completed todos. Similar to `TodoList`, it receives the list of completed todos as props and displays them accordingly. Each completed todo item has an option to delete.

## Conclusion üéâ

This simple todo app demonstrates the basic concepts of React, including state management, props, and component structure. It provides a foundation for building more complex applications.
